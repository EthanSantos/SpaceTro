- Resolving merge conflicts between front-end and back-end

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Implementing a point system for scoring in quizzes
- Creating a full stack web app within 24 hours

## What we learned
- Test LLM prompts within Gemini before integrating
- Figure out page routing before implementing back-end

## What's next for SpaceTro
- Display ranks and module completions on LinkedIn
- Incorporate a wider range of media for learning (e.g., videos, games, simulations)
